"Record linkage" is the term used by statisticians, epidemiologists, and historians, among others,
to describe the process of joining records from one data source with another that describe the same entity.

The general structure of the problem is something like this: we have a large collection
of records from one or more source systems, and it is likely that multiple records
refer to the same underlying entity, such as a customer, a patient, or the location of a
business or an event. Each entity has a number of attributes, such as a name, an
address, or a birthday, and we will need to use these attributes to find the records that
refer to the same entity.
